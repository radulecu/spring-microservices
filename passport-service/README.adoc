= Resource server which uses other resource servers

This module has few tricks under his belt:

- The basic function is to provide resources
- Uses other resource servers to prove that authentication can be forwarded to other resources
- It is used also as a web client to provide other details (e.g. in this case hystrix details from <url>/hystrix.stream but other actuator tools work the same )
- Zuul/Histrix/Ribbon/Feign for resources
